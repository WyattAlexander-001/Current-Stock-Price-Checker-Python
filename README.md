# Current-Stock-Price-Checker-Python

The purpose of this project was to make a simple application, in Python, that will tell user the current stock price, and will automatically refresh to keep the most up to date price. The user would input their stock name or ticker symbol and this would match the dictionary key to pull the url value. That url is saved as a parameter to then run the program through the function. The current dictionary is small, but can be built to match the userâ€™s portfolio.
